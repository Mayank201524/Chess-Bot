### **Chess Bot â€“ AI-Powered Competitive Chess Engine**  

#### **Project Overview**  
This project is a **competitive chess bot** implemented in Python using **Pygame**. It supports key chess mechanics and integrates **AI-based decision-making** using the **Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning and Quiescence Search** to play strategically at different difficulty levels.

### **Features**  
âœ… **Complete Chess Mechanics** â€“ Implements legal move generation, check, checkmate, stalemate detection, castling, pawn promotion, and move undoing.  
âœ… **AI-Powered Opponent** â€“ Uses **Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning** for efficient decision-making.  
âœ… **Move Evaluation & Ordering** â€“ Prioritizes captures and strong positional moves using an **advanced evaluation function**.  
âœ… **Quiescence Search** â€“ Extends search depth for tactical positions to prevent the **horizon effect**.  
âœ… **Interactive GUI** â€“ Built with **Pygame**, allowing users to play against the AI in a visually engaging chessboard interface.  
âœ… **Multiple AI Difficulty Levels** â€“ Depth-based AI difficulty selection for challenging gameplay.

### **Tech Stack**  
- **Python** â€“ Core programming language  
- **Pygame** â€“ GUI and chessboard visualization  
- **Minimax Algorithm** â€“ AI decision-making  
- **Alpha-Beta Pruning** â€“ Optimized search performance  
- **Quiescence Search** â€“ Tactical move extension  

---

### **How It Works**  
1. **Move Generation** â€“ The bot generates all legal moves for the current board state.  
2. **AI Decision-Making** â€“ The **Minimax algorithm** evaluates future moves, applying **Alpha-Beta pruning** to speed up search.  
3. **Evaluation Function** â€“ Considers piece value, mobility, threats, and positional advantages.  
4. **Move Execution** â€“ The best move is selected, and the game updates accordingly.
